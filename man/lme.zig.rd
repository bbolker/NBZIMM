\title{
  Zero-Inflated Gaussian Mixed Models
}

\description{
  This function sets up and fits zero-inflated gaussian mixed models for analyzing zero-inflated continuous responses with multilevel data structures (for example, clustered data and longitudinal studies).    
}

\usage{  
lme.zig(fixed, random, data, correlation, 
        zi_fixed = ~1, zi_random = NULL,
        niter = 30, epsilon = 1e-05, verbose = TRUE, ...)  
}

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{fixed}{ 
  a formula for the fixed-effects part of the Gaussian model, including the continuous normal outcome. This argument is the same as in the function \code{\link{lme}} in the package \bold{nlme}.
}
  \item{random}{ 
  a formula for the random-effects part of the Gaussian model. It only contain the right-hand side part, e.g., ~ time | id, where time is a variable, and id the grouping factor. This argument is the same as in the function \code{\link{lme}} in the package \bold{nlme}.
}
  \item{data}{ 
  a data.frame containing all the variables. 
}
  \item{correlation}{ 
  an optional correlation structure. It is the same as in the function \code{\link{lme}} in the package \bold{nlme}.
}
  \item{zi_fixed, zi_random}{
  formulas for the fixed and random effects of the zero inflated part. only contain the right-hand side part. 
}
  \item{niter}{
  maximum number of iterations. 
}
 \item{epsilon}{
  positive convergence tolerance.
}
  \item{verbose}{
  logical. If \code{TRUE}, print out number of iterations and computational time.
}
  \item{...}{
  further arguments for \code{\link{lme}}.  
}

}

\details{
  Zero-inflated gaussian models are two-component mixture models combining a point mass at zero with Gaussian (normal) for continuous outcome. Thus, there are two sources of zeros: zeros may come from either the point mass at zero or the normal distribution. For modeling the unobserved state, a logistic model (or logistic mixed model) is used.
  
  The function is an alteration of the function \code{\link{glmmPQL}} in the package \bold{MASS}, which fits generalized linear mixed models using Penalized Quasi-Likelihood and works by repeated calls to the function \code{\link{lme}} in the package \bold{nlme}. It incorporates EM algorithms into the procedure of \code{\link{glmmPQL}} to fit zero-inflated mixed models for analyzing zero-inflated continuous responses in mutilevel study designs, for example, clustered and longitudinal studies. The function allows for multiple and correlated group-specific (random) effects (the argument \code{random}) and various types of within-group correlation structures (the argument \code{correlation}) described by \code{\link{corStruct}} in the package \bold{nlme}. 
  
}

\value{
  A fitted model object of class \code{lme} inheriting from \code{\link{lme}}, which can be summarized by functions in the package \bold{nlme} for the distribution part.
  
  The object contains additional components for the zero-inflation part: 
\item{zero.prob}{the zero-state probabilities;}
\item{zero.indicator}{the conditional expectations of the zero indicators;}
\item{zi.fit}{the fitted logistic (mixed) model for the zero-inflation part;}
